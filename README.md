Welcome, here you will find some of my previous work in technical writing. My experience includes working on a statewide cannabis tracking software system for the California Department of Food & Agriculture, as well as providing product descriptions and images for the product catalogs for two nationally-recognized construction brands, Interstate Pnuematics and AirLocker.
