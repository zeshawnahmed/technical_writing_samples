Welcome! here you will find previous projects that I have contributed to with regards to technical writing.

My experience includes working on a statewide cannabis tracking software system for the California Department of Food & Agriculture, as well as providing extensive product descriptions and images for the product catalogs for two nationally-recognized construction brands, Interstate Pnuematics and AirLocker. 

In addition, I have wrote a handful of technical articles related to my web design work that can be found via my design portfolio here:
