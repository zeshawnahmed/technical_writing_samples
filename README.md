Welcome! Here you will find previous projects that I have contributed to in the realm of technical writing.

My experience includes: <br>
-working on documentation and user manual related to a statewide cannabis tracking software system for the California Department of Food & Agriculture <br><br>
-a regulatory compliance handbook for the California Department of Food & Agriculture <br><br>
-providing extensive product descriptions and images for the product catalogs of two nationally-recognized construction brands, Interstate Pnuematics and AirLocker. <br><br>

In addition, I have written a handful of technical articles related to my web design work that can be found on my personal design website here:
